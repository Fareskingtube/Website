                <ul>
                    <li><span class="liitem">Calm Your Cat:</span> Start by creating a relaxed environment. Play with your cat or use a soothing voice to make them feel comfortable.
                    <li><span class="liitem">Hold the Paw Gently:</span> Securely but gently hold your cat's paw. Press on the paw pad to extend the claw.
                    <li><span class="liitem">Identify the Quick:</span> The quick is the pink part inside the claw that contains nerves and blood vessels. Avoid cutting this area.

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="liitem">Start Slow:</span> If your cat is new to nail trims, begin by trimming just a few nails at a time. Gradually increase the number as they get used to the process.
                    <li><span class="liitem">Stop if Uncomfortable:</span> If your cat becomes agitated or stressed, stop and reschedule the trimming for another time.
